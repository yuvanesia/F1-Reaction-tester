# F1-Reaction-tester
F1 reaction time game (Lights Out start) built with HTML/CSS/JS. Tracks personal bests against a leaderboard. Built with AI assistance for design and code structure acceleration. Fully responsive.
The F1 Reflex Test is a web-based application designed to measure and track human reaction times using a gamified interface inspired by Formula 1 racing. The core objective of this project was to create an engaging, fast-loading tool that accurately simulates the "Lights Out" Grand Prix starting procedure. Built entirely using standard web technologies, the game provides an immediate, competitive benchmark against a high-score leaderboard while saving the user's personal best time locally.
​Technical Implementation
​The application is built using a single, self-contained file encompassing HTML5 for structural markup, CSS3 for advanced styling, and vanilla JavaScript for all game logic. No external frameworks were used. Key features include:
​Dynamic Game States: Management of three primary states: START, READY (random delay), and GO (timing).
​Timing Precision: The core logic uses Date.now() to calculate reaction time to the millisecond, providing high-precision results.
​Thematic Design: Custom CSS was used to achieve the F1 aesthetic, including a carbon fiber background, italicized 'speed' typography, and red/white racing kerbs, ensuring a fully responsive mobile-first design.
​Local Persistence: The JavaScript localStorage API is used to persistently save the user's best time and the current high-score leaderboard on their device.
​🤖 AI Contribution
​The project utilized a Large Language Model (LLM) for key aspects of development and presentation, significantly accelerating the process:
​Design Consultation: The AI was used to brainstorm and refine the F1-themed visual design, including the use of specific color palettes and the CSS implementation of the carbon fiber pattern and the racing kerb borders.
​Code Structure and Refinement: The core JavaScript logic for state management, timer control, and the leaderboard structure was drafted and refined using the LLM, ensuring adherence to modern web standards and responsive event handling.
​Documentation and Readability: The LLM generated this project abstract and the repository description, helping to concisely articulate the project's features and technical stack for external review.
​Conclusion
​This project successfully demonstrates the integration of simple, effective game mechanics with advanced styling techniques. The use of AI tools in the development process allowed for a faster iteration cycle on design aesthetics and documentation, resulting in a clean, functional, and visually appealing web application.
